This repository presents all code used in the experiments of our work entitled "Exploring
Cross-Lingual Cascade-Learning Models for Fake News Detection in Spanish". This
work combines cascade-learning with the usage of multi-lingual word embeddings
in order to transfer learning from high-resource languaces, in this case
English, to lower-resource languages, in particular Spanish. More specifically,
it combines the tasks of _stance classification_ and _bot detection_ as
auxiliary tasks to the main tasks of _fake news detection_.

All models have been trained on different GPUs, with at least
12GB of memory, using the [vast.ai](https://vast.ai) platform.
